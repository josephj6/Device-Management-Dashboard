One of my main goals in any work environment is to optimize workflow and increase efficiency. When problems arise in these areas, my goal is to solve them. 
As a part-time Retail Associate at NIKE, a recurring issue that our team of 70+ kept facing was inconsistent employee device (AD) logging. Currently, this process is done by hand using pen and paper.
I saw an area for opportunity with digitizing the AD logging process and identified the potential impacts:
    better legibility (remove guesswork that may come with reading handwriting),
    accurate time records (NTP),
    portability (employees can log as soon as device is in-hand),
    and the ablity for management to see a simple, digital view of exactly where devices are and who has them in an intuitive and easy-to-read format.

 As a result, and by utilizing Python and Replit, the Device Management Dasboard DMD was born. With the DMD employees login as they would with every other NIKE internal app, by entering their ID number and password.
 DMD will then intuitively prompt the user to select their specific AD and mobile payment terminal number from the 2 respective dropdown menus. Once employees hit 'checkout', their name, device, checkout times, and whether or not devices have been returned are recorded in an easy-to-read table. 
 Once employees are done with devices and ready to return them, they will hit the respective 'return device' buttons and the return time will be logged in the same table. Employees do not have permissions to view this table.

 Management has the same check-in/check-out process, as well as increased permissions. Theyre able to view the table showing device posession, times, and location of ADs. They are also able to manually return or check-out devices for employees. Additionally, they can search devices by employee, checkout time, or day which helps in pinpointing where (and with who) a missing AD was seen last.

 Additional features/benefits that ensure functionality and efficiency:

   - Impossible for two devices to be checked out at the same time: devices removed as check-out option once assigned to an employee
   - Search feature with advanced filters to aid in device tracking
   - Ability to automate and digitize the AD auditing process, leading to more accurate audits and less operational loss
   - Principle of Least Privlege
   - Less waste by saving paper
